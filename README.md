# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Machine-Learning-Project

We used 4 inbuilt machine learning algorithms from sklearn toolkit library to model the data.
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Decision Tree Classifier


To handle imbalanced nature of data, we took that into consider in the testing set, by using *proper evaluation metrics* like Accuracy and F1-Score and *k-fold cross-validation*.
